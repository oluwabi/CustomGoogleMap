# CustomGoogleMap
This is a customized map with Erin Ijesha WaterFall location but named Jurassic Park
I tried to hide my API key but was not successful so you need to update the key with your API key
I added some Dinosaurs features and also you can get google icons on any location you click on the map

Thanks for passingby.
